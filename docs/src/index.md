# Catalyst.jl for Reaction Models

`Catalyst.jl` is a domain specific language (DSL) for easily specifying chemical
reactions and generating corresponding [`ModelingToolkit.ReactionSystem`](@ref)s
to encode the models. It helps users quickly build discrete stochastic and
differential equation based representations of biological and chemical models,
which can then be solved and analyzed using [SciML](https://sciml.ai) packages.
These tools allow one to define the models at a high level by specifying
reactions and rate constants, with the creation of the actual SciML `Problem`s
then handled by [ModelingToolkit](https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl).

## Features
- DSL provides a simple and readable format for manually specifying chemical reactions.
- [Catalyst.jl API](@ref) provides functionality for extending networks, building networks programmatically, and for composing multiple networks together.
- `ReactionSystem`s generated by the DSL can be converted to a variety of `ModelingToolkit.AbstractSystem`s, including ODE, SDE and jump process representations.
- By leveraging ModelingToolkit, users have a variety of options for generating optimized system representations to use in solvers. These include construction of dense or sparse Jacobians, multithreading or parallelization of generated derivative functions, automatic classification of reactions into optimized jump types for Gillespie type simulations, automatic construction of dependency graphs for jump systems, and more.
- Generated systems can be solved using any [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) ODE/SDE/jump solver, and can be used within `EnsembleProblem`s for carrying out parameter sweeps and statistical sampling. Plot recipes are available for visualizing the solutions.

## Installation

Catalyst can be installed through the Julia package manager:

```julia
]add Catalyst
using Catalyst
```

## An Illustrative Example
Here is a simple example of generating and solving an SIR ODE model:

```julia
using Catalyst, DiffEqBase, OrdinaryDiffEq
rn = @reaction_network begin
    k1, S + I --> 2I
    k2, I --> R
end k1 k2
p     = [.1/1000, .01]           # [k1,k2]
tspan = (0.0,250.0) 
u0    = [999.0,1.0,0.0]          # [S,I,R] at t=0
op    = ODEProblem(rn, u0, tspan, p)
sol   = solve(op, Tsit5())       # use Tsit5 ODE solver
```
which we can plot as
```julia
using Plots
plot(sol)
```
