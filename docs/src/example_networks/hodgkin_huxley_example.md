## Hodgkin-Huxley Equation as a Constraint ODE
In many applications one may want to have coupled ODEs or algebraic equations associated with a chemical reaction network.

These can be used in Catalyst via constraint systems.

Constraint systems can be ModelingToolkit ODESystems or NonlinearSystems.
