To aid the visualisation of spatial simulations, we provide 6 different plot recipes, covering the following situations:
- For a 1d structured (Cartesian or masked) grid, plot its value at a single time point.
- For a 1d structured grid, plot a kymograph of a single species's value over time.
- For a 2d structured grid, plot a single species's value at a single time point.
- For a 2d structured grid, create an animation of a single species's value over time.
- For an unstructured grid, where the user provides the coordinates of each vertex, plot a species's value at a single time point. 
- For an unstructured grid, where the user provides the coordinates of each vertex,  create an animation of a single species's value over time.
